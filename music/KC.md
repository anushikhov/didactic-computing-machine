## King Crimson  

King Crimson is my favorite band.

And it's not because I share Robert Fripp's birthday, it's because Bill Bruford was born on May 17.

No, actually... "In the Court of the Crimson King".

I first heard them when I was 17-18... so that is around 10 years ago. At the time I was also in love with crimson (the color) and Gregg Lake's voice. The latter is still true, while the former is ... blue... dark blue.  

Okay, but seriously...

Epitaph...

In fact, at the time I stopped attending to my guitar classes because when I sent it to my coach, he said he was unimpressed.

Being completely useless I dropped out of uni and started working at a supermarket to support my family. The superhuman experience was accompanied by the "sophistication" of the mainstream music to make the torture more profound. Once I told the guy about the music that was under my ears there for eight to ten hours, and we both ended up crying.   

Over the years my ears have grown accustomed to both the mainstream music and the mainstream people with their mainstream choices.   

But I also bought my very own classical guitar.   

But as I said... I ran away from my last music teacher.

He only appreciated technique... well... https://youtu.be/IHjxgHDWtwY?si=SSq9mq3kC8w_sPcS

I can't imagine how Bill did the Sheltering Skies... it seems truly superhuman...

...

Right before one of those conditional cycles ends I listen to something I am deeply in love with.

Every year, an hour before my birthday, I go to a place where there's only me, put on my headphones and listen to Dream Theater's Octavarium... I dance in the dark like a psycho and sing along without voice... I would totally sing aloud too if I knew nobody would hear me... I would sing all the time if I knew it was only me listening.

December 31, 2025, 4am-5am, my room had an open window, snow and fresh air outside and the following on: https://youtu.be/0ju5LRTMFLw?si=82_F43iDZ-lRjx-h

What else do I need? well, certain people alive and some more Mathematics... besides that, I have everything... I've found everything.
