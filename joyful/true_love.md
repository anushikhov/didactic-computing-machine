**Every number is interesting! Otherwise, there'd be a smallest uninteresting number, and that would make it interesting.**  

**Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irrelevent and original manner possible.**     

**What if we see a ghost? -Well, if you see a ghost, you say hello and continue on studying.**  

**No matter how pathetic you feel, you must do what you can at the moment.**   

**Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.**  

If something burns your soul with purpose and desire, it's your duty to be reduced to ashes by it. Any other form of existence will be yet another dull book in the library of life.
