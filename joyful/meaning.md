**In case no one told you today:**  
* Life is decay  
* You will always truly be alone  
* You are expendable  
* Nothing happens for a reason  
* You're going to die  
* You will be forgotten  
* It will be like you never existed  


**Everything happens for a reason.**  
**Sometimes the reason is you're stupid and you make bad decisions.**  

Every time I find the meaning of life they change it.   

You are not useless. You can be used as a bad example.
