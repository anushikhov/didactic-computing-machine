"You used my love as a victory for your ego. It never really entered your heart."  

"In a relationship there's a flower and a gardener. I'm a gardener who wants to be a flower. How f\*ed am I?"  

"Can't be love if it does this to you, can it?"  

"It is true that I am endowed with an absurd sensitiveness; what scratches others tears me to pieces."
