"How does one hate a country, or love one?    
I know people, I know towns,farms, hills and rivers and rocks,    
I know how the sun at sunset in autumn falls on the side of a certain plowland in the hills;    
but what is the sense of giving a boundary to all that,    
of giving it a name and ceasing to love where the name ceases to apply?    
What is love of one's country; is it hate of one's uncountry?    
THen it's not a good thing.    
Is it simply self-love?    
That's a good thing, but one mustn't make a virtue of it, or a profession.    
Insofar as I love life, I love the hills of the Domain of Estre,    
but that sort of love does not have a boundary-line of hate.    
And beyond that, I am ignorant, I hope.
