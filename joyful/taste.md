To live content with small means - to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion, to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not rich - to study hard, think quitely, talk gently, act frankly, ..., with open heart - to bear all cheerfully - do all bravely, await occasions - never hurry.
