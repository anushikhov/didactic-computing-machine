A practical trust ladder:     
* Primary sources (best when you can): original papers, standards, textbooks.   
* Secondary sources: survey papers, reputable course notes, encyclopedias.   
* Tertiary sources: Wikipedia, blogs, random PDFs.   
   
The “2-source rule” (kills 80% of doubt)   
For any factual claim you want to believe:   
* Find two independent sources that agree, where at least one is higher on the trust ladder.   
* If you can’t, label it “uncertain / to verify later” and move on.   
   
This prevents you from spiraling.   

Use Wikipedia the right way.   
   
When you read a Wikipedia sentence:   
* Treat it as a hypothesis.   
* Scroll to the references and click one good one (textbook, classic paper, reputable lecture notes).   
* If the reference doesn’t actually support it → mark the sentence as “wobbly.”   
   
You don’t have to “stop trusting Wikipedia”; just stop treating it as final authority.   

How to use ChatGPT without getting burned   
   
Use it for:   
* Explanations   
* Reframing definitions   
* Derivations   
* Finding what to verify   
* Pointing out ambiguity (“this is linguistics vs math usage”)   
   
A good mental model: ChatGPT is a smart tutor, not a library.   

A tiny mantra that helps   
   
“I don’t need certainty; I need a stable working model.”   
   
If a definition is “good enough to solve problems and communicate,” it’s good enough for now. You can refine it later when it matters.   


Apply this to your examples:   
* “Numeral system is part of natural language…”   
 → That’s true in linguistics, false/partial in math/CS. Not “wrong”, just “domain-scoped.”   
* “Information theory is intersection of X,Y,Z…”   
→ That’s a Wikipedia-ish “broad influence” statement, but a sharper view is: probability/math + communications/EE + CS, with lots of applications.
