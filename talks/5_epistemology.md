There are **classics in epistemology**, but **no single “canonical” book gives a universally accepted, strict taxonomy** the way (say) a math text gives definitions + theorems. Epistemology is partly *about* why clean definitions (like “knowledge = …”) keep breaking under counterexamples.   
   
That said, there *are* classics that are as “definition-and-categorization-heavy” as epistemology gets, depending on what you mean by strict:   
   
### If you mean “systematic distinctions and crisp categories” (but still philosophical)   
   
* **Roderick Chisholm — *Theory of Knowledge***: very taxonomy-oriented (kinds of justification, basic distinctions, etc.).

* **A. J. Ayer — *The Problem of Knowledge*** (and related mid-20th-century analytic epistemology): structured, definitional style.   
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459898/page/n7/mode/2up  
* Modern “classic textbook” style: **Robert Audi — *Epistemology*** (very organized; lots of clean distinctions).   
https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~biglars/epis.pdf  

Very organized and “map-like”: it’s built to give you the conceptual grid (knowledge vs justification, sources of belief, standards of evidence, etc.).

### If you mean “formal strictness” (definitions that behave like math)   
   
* **Jaakko Hintikka — *Knowledge and Belief***: **epistemic logic** (knowledge/belief operators, axioms, proof rules).   
* **Formal epistemology / Bayesian epistemology**: frameworks where “justification” becomes probabilistic coherence, updating rules, decision norms.   
   
### If you mean “strict buckets for sciences / kinds of inquiry”   
   
That’s more **philosophy of science** than epistemology:   
   
* **Karl Popper — *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*** (demarcation, falsifiability as a crisp criterion—controversial, but sharp).   
https://www.raggeduniversity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/popper-logic-scientific-discovery-ilovepdf-compressed.pdf     
   
* **Carl Hempel — *Philosophy of Natural Science*** (models of explanation, confirmation).

Laurence BonJour — Epistemology: Classic Problems and Contemporary Responses

Also systematic, but structured around “classic problems → major response families,” which naturally produces crisp categories.    

John Pollock & Joseph Cruz — Contemporary Theories of Knowledge

More “theory taxonomy”: it lines up the big competing pictures (foundationalism/coherentism/reliabilism, etc.) and compares them in a structured way.   

A quick warning that matters for your “strict boundaries” goal: in epistemology, even when definitions are precise, they’re often treated as proposals to be tested (Gettier-style counterexamples, skeptical scenarios, etc.), so you get “strict and disputed,” rather than “strict and final.”
