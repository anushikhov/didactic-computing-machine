If you want a *book-centered* way to learn bases (from “what is a base?” all the way to deeper theory), these are the best “anchors,” depending on what you mean by *base number systems*:

## Best single starting point (rigorous + very thorough)

**Donald Knuth — *The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2: Seminumerical Algorithms***
It opens its arithmetic chapter with **positional number systems**, conversions, and then builds up into how arithmetic is actually done (including representations and floating-point topics). ([InformIT][1])

## Best “clean course” book (CS / hardware angle, very readable)

**Behrooz Parhami — *Computer Arithmetic: Algorithms and Hardware Designs***
Great if you want number systems *as used in computing*: binary/hex, signed representations, fixed vs floating point, and the algorithms/hardware ideas behind operations. ([Amazon][2])

## Best for “numeration systems” as a mathematical subject (bases + many generalizations)

**Jeffrey Shallit — *The Logical Approach to Automatic Sequences***
Has an early chapter explicitly on **number representations and numeration systems**, including nonstandard ones (e.g., Fibonacci, Ostrowski, etc.), and connects them to formal languages/automata. ([PagePlace][3])

(If you want even deeper: **Allouche & Shallit — *Automatic Sequences*** is a classic reference in the same world.) ([Cheriton School of Computer Science][4])

## If your real interest is specifically base-60 (sexagesimal) and why it existed

**Otto Neugebauer — *The Exact Sciences in Antiquity***
A well-known historical source that explains the Babylonian sexagesimal system early on. ([Mathematical Association of America][5])
Also excellent context: **Eleanor Robson — *Mathematics in Ancient Iraq***. ([Amazon][6])

## Free “survey” to see the bigger landscape (good preview before committing)

**V. Bruyère — “Automata and Numeration Systems”** (survey-style, includes standard bases and nonstandard ones like Fibonacci). ([Emis][7])

---

If you want a simple path: **Knuth (positional basics) → Parhami (how machines encode/compute) → Shallit (general numeration systems + theory)**, and then Neugebauer/Robson if you want the historical base-60 angle.
