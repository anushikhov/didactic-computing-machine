You can enjoy **a lot** of it over your lifetime. Math is effectively infinite; the win is building a life where you keep *entering new rooms* and going deep in the ones you love.

What makes it doable with a full-time job is choosing the right tempo and definition of “cover.”

## The realistic version of “all of it”

Think in three levels:

1. **Literacy** (recognize the main ideas, read expositions, know what a theorem is saying)
2. **Working competence** (solve standard problems, follow proofs, do exercises)
3. **Depth/mastery** (you could teach it, or use it creatively)

Over decades you can get:

* literacy in *many* areas,
* working competence in *several*,
* deep mastery in *one to three*.

That’s already an amazing life in math.

## Time math (the comforting kind)

If you average even **5–7 hours/week** of genuine study (very doable around a job):

* that’s ~250–350 hours/year
* over 10 years: **2,500–3,500 hours**
* over 30 years: **7,500–10,500 hours**

That’s enough to do multiple serious runs through analysis/algebra/probability/etc., especially if you recycle your notes and keep projects.

## The method that keeps it fun (and prevents burnout)

### 1) One “spine” + rotating “seasons”

* **Spine (always):** something foundational you revisit forever (proofs + linear algebra + probability are great spines)
* **Seasons (3–6 months):** you go deep on one topic (e.g., real analysis), finish a tranche, then rotate (e.g., abstract algebra)

Rotation is how a curious brain stays alive.

### 2) Always attach a “toy project” or “artifact”

Not big. Just something that makes the topic yours:

* write a 3–5 page explanation
* implement a small algorithm
* collect 20 solved problems + commentary
* make a “theorem map” page

This keeps it enjoyable and cumulative.

### 3) Keep a “math menu,” not a math guilt list

Have:

* **Main dish:** current season topic
* **Side dish:** something light (history of math, a beautiful geometry book, puzzles)
* **Dessert:** pure curiosity (a lecture, a wiki rabbit-hole) with no guilt

You don’t need permission to wander; you just need a structure so wandering doesn’t erase progress.

## The honest constraint

The only thing you can’t have is: **deep mastery of everything** *and* constant novelty *and* a full-time job *without* tradeoffs.

But you can have:

* deep mastery of a couple pillars,
* broad literacy across many,
* and a lifelong stream of “new and cool.”

That’s a great deal.

## A simple lifelong plan that matches your personality

* **Yearly cadence:** 2 seasons/year (one heavy, one playful)
* **Pillars you revisit forever:** proofs, linear algebra, probability
* **Rotate through:** analysis ↔ algebra ↔ topology/geometry ↔ discrete/combinatorics ↔ stats/ML
