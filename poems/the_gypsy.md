**The Gypsy**      
   
_Do not stand_     
_By my grave, and weep._     
_I am not there,_     
_I do not sleep_     
_I am the thousand winds that blow_     
_I am the diamond glints in snow_     
_I am the sunlight on ripened grain,_     
_I am the gentle, autumn rain._     
_As you awake with morning’s hush,_     
_I am the swift, up-flinging rush_     
_Of quiet birds in circling flight,_     
_I am the day transcending night._     
_Do not stand_     
_By my grave, and cry_     
_I am not there,_     
_I did not die._
