**Coat**  

_Sometimes I have wanted_  
_to throw you off_  
_like a heavy coat._  

_Sometimes I have said_  
_you would not let me_  
_breathe or move._  

_But now that I am free_  
_to choose light clothes_  
_or none at all_  

_I feel the cold_  
_and all the time I think_  
_how warm it used to be._  

Vicki Feaver (November 14th 1943)
