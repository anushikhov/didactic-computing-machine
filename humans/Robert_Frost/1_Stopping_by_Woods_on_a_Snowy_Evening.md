Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening  

By Robert Frost  

_Whose woods these are I think I know._
_His house is in the village though;_
_He will not see me stopping here_    
_To watch his woods fill up with snow._    
  
_My little horse must think it queer_    
_To stop without a farmhouse near_    
_Between the woods and frozen lake_    
_The darkest evening of the year._    
  
_He gives his harness bells a shake_    
_To ask if there is some mistake._    
_The only other sound’s the sweep_    
_Of easy wind and downy flake._    
  
_The woods are lovely, dark and deep,_    
_But I have promises to keep,_    
_And miles to go before I sleep,_    
_And miles to go before I sleep._
