_Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution._  - Aristotle   

_Maybe working on the little things as dutifully and honestly as we can is how we stay sane when the world is falling apart._  - Haruki Murakami  

_You must push yourself until your nose starts bleeding._  - Hayao Miyazaki  

_Many of my movies have strong female leads - brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart. They'll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior. Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man._   - Hayao Miyazaki   

Wake yourself up.  
Shake your days up.   
Remind yourself why you're here.  
What drives you?   
What makes your spirit tremble with excitement?  
Go after that thing.   
Pursue it with passion and joy.  
Wrap your dreams around the hope for a better future.  
And then make those dreams a reality - your reality.  
Fall in love with life again.
